# mtb-example-psoc6-smartio-sgpio-target
This example uses a SPI resource and Smart I/O in PSoC 6 MCU to implement the Serial General Purpose Input/Output (SGPIO) Target interface, which is a four-signal bus defined in the SFF-8485 standard. Another SPI resource is used to implement the SGPIO Initiator, which drives the clock on the SGPIO bus.
