# PSoC 6 MCU: SGPIO Target Interface

This example uses a SPI resource and Smart I/O in PSoC 6 MCU to implement the Serial General Purpose Input/Output (SGPIO) Target interface, which is a four-signal bus defined in the [SFF-8485](https://members.snia.org/document/dl/25923) standard. Another SPI resource is used to implement the SGPIO Initiator, which drives the clock on the SGPIO bus.

## Hardware Setup

This example implements a loop back between the SGPIO Target and SGPIO Master. External wiring is required between pins.

**Table 1. External Wire Connections**

| Kit's Name  |  Pins to connect | SGPIO Signal Description |
| :------- | :------------    | :---- |
| CY8CPROTO-062-4343W | P9[0] to P13[0] <br> P9[1] to P13[1] <br> P9[2] to P13[2] <br> P9[3] to P13[3] | SDataOut <br> SDataIn <br> SClock <br> SLoad  |
| All other kits | P9[0] to P10[0] <br> P9[1] to P10[1] <br> P9[2] to P10[2] <br> P9[3] to P10[3] | SDataOut <br> SDataIn <br> SClock <br> SLoad |

Pins from Port 9 are mapped to the SGPIO Target. Pins from Port 13 or 10 are mapped to the SGPIO Initiator.

**Note:** Only Port 9 and Port 8 support Smart I/O. That means the SGPIO Target can only be placed in the 0~3 pins of these two ports.

**Note:** For this example project using the above pin connections, the PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) requires a zero-ohm resistor to be added at R131.

**Note:** For this example project using the above pin connections, the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) requires a zero-ohm resistor to be added at R162.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the Quick Panel. 

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created. 

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps.

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work. 

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the [CLI](#in-command-line-interface-cli) section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command. 

    For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

## Operation

If using a PSoC 64 Secure MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC 64 Secure MCU must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the [Secure Boot SDK User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:**

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   - **Using CLI:**

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "Smart I/O SGPIO Target" is displayed on the UART terminal.

    **Figure 1. Terminal Output on Program Startup**

    ![Figure 1](images/terminal-initial.png)

5. The device constantly writes the same data to the SGPIO bus. Press the kit's user button to print the latest status of the device. Confirm that the terminal displays the following information:

    **Figure 2. Terminal Output on Button Press**

    ![Figure 2](images/terminal-info.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and Implementation

This design provides middleware files (*sgpio_target.c/h*) to implement the SGPIO Target interface. It requires an SPI resource and a Smart I/O resource. All the initialization of these blocks are handled by the middleware. You need to configure only the clocks and pin assignment for the SPI and Smart I/O.

### SGPIO Interface Overview

The SGPIO interface time diagram is shown below. It streams information about 4 drives, where each drive contains 3 bits.

**Figure 3. Repeating Bit Stream (from SFF-8485)**

![Figure 3](images/sgpio-bitstream.png)

Due to the similarities to the SPI interface, you can leverage the SPI Master to simulate the SGPIO Initiator. The SPI Master is configured with *Sub Mode* set to *TI (Start Coincides)* and the data width set to 12 (size of the SGPIO frame for 4 drives).

**Figure 4. SPI Frame as SGPIO Initiator**

![Figure 4](images/spi-frame.png)

**Note:** the SGPIO Target can support up to 20 drives, but the SGPIO Initiator in this example only works with 4 drives.

The mapping between the two interfaces is shown below:

**Table 2. SPI and SGPIO Mapping**

| SPI Signal  |  SGPIO Signal  | Description |   
| ------- | ------------  | ---- |
| SCLK | SClock          | Clock driven by the SPI Master / SGPIO Initiator |
| MOSI | SDataOut | Data driven by the SPI Master / SGPIO Initiator |
| MISO | SDataIn | Data driven by the SPI Slave / SGPIO Target |
| SS | SLoad | Indicates when the bit stream starts. |

**Note:** SLoad in the SGPIO interface contains some additional vendor-specific bits. These bits are not supported in this implementation.

Each SGPIO frame contains information about a drive. It has three bits and can indicate the drive's information like activity, location, and errors.

### Clocking

The SGPIO Interface requires a bus clock of up to 100 KHz. Therefore, the SPI Master (SGPIO Initiator) data rate is configured to 100 kbps.

The SPI Slave (SGPIO Target) data rate is configured to a higher data rate (1000 kbps) to work with the Smart I/O, which is sourced by the same clock linked to the SGPIO Target.

### Firmware Overview

The firmware is designed to constantly send data over the SGPIO interface. When the kit's button is pressed, the drive's information is printed to the terminal. 

The SGPIO Target init function requires an SPI resource and Smart I/O resource as arguments. The SPI resource is configured to generate an interrupt when the Rx buffer is not empty. The interrupt handler parses the bits to construct the SGPIO frame, so that you can use high-level functions in the firmware to read/write to the SGPIO bus.

The Smart I/O resource is configured to translate the SGPIO-SLoad signal to SPI-SS signal. It uses the internal LUTs to detect the rising edge of the SGPIO-SLoad signal, which indicates when the SPI-SS signal needs to assert. The data lines between the SPI and SGPIO behaves identically, not requiring any manipulation by the Smart I/O resource.

There are two interrupts in this code example:
- *button_interrupt_handler:* It triggers on the kit's button presses. It sets a flag to be read in the main loop.

- *sgpio_interrupt_handler:* It triggers when the SGPIO Target's internal FIFO has data. It executes the SGPIO Target middleware interrupt function.
